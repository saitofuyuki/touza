* Introduction
*TOUZA/ami* (or ami-da) is a collection of Fortran subroutines for
`coupling'.  `ami-da' stands for ami(friend) drvies associates.

The original motivation to develop this package is to replace
legacy =pgcpl.F= in MIROC, with improving the interfaces and
the algorithms to control the domain decomposition and parallel
communication.

*TOUZA/ami* is maintained by SAITO Fuyuki <saitofuyuki AT jamstec
DOT go DOT jp>.

*TOUZA (楊座)*, MIROC base infrastructure, is a collection of
Fortran procedures mainly adopted in MIROC.  See *TOUZA* README
(expected to be in the parent directory) for general instruction of
*TOUZA* collection.
